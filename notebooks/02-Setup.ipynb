    "A virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- provides a way to create a self-contained python environment,\n",
    "- avoids breaking existing workflows by isolating the environment,\n",
    "- is to create and remove, and\n",
    "- helps keep dependencies consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create one?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools for creating virtual environments. Two common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conda`: Powerful, capable of installing system-level libraries (in addition to python packages), handles installation of the python runtime itself\n",
    "- `venv`: Lightweight, part of the python standard library, requires an existing python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What about colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If working directly in a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) notebook, you are already working in a virtual environment. You can use `pip` directly in a Colab cell to install the packages you need.\n",
    "- Each colab notebook is situated in its own implicit virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if working in colab, you can simply run `!pip install pycontrails` in your first notebook cell to install `pycontrails` in the environment."
